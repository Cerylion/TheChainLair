          <h2>The Artist</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Manuel Mor√°n, the artist and craftsperson behind The Chain Lair. 
            My journey with chainmaille began when I met my first crew of misfits back on university. I was studying Psychology, and they were studying Computer Sciences. With them I discovered the 
            fascinating clash between a historical craft and modern design possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 22 years of experience in chainmaille techniques, 
            I've developed a style that blends traditional patterns with contemporary applications.
            Each piece I create is handcrafted with meticulous attention to detail and a 
            commitment to quality that ensures durability and beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not weaving rings, you can find me watching Godzilla reruns, recording music that only I like, or playing videogames. Recently, even programming. For instance, I made this site myself.

          <h2 className="text-center mb-4">My Process</h2>
          <p>
            Each chainmaille piece begins with carefully selected materials - primarily 
            high-quality metals like Sterling Silver, Stainless Steel and Niquel Plated Steel. 
            I source rings from reputable suppliers or make them myself, ensuring consistent 
            size and quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creation process involves connecting hundreds or thousands of individual rings 
            in specific patterns. Depending on the complexity and size of the piece, this can 
            take anywhere from several hours to several weeks to complete. The biggest projects I've worked on have taken months to complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm particularly interested in bringing chainmaille weaves to a modern era. Lamps and illumination are my passion as of the moment,
            though I enjoy experimenting with new weaves and applications regularly.
