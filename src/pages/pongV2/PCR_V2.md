## ✅ Completed Achievements

### Phase 1: Foundation & Utilities (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Configuration Constants Extraction**: All magic numbers centralized into GAME_CONFIG object
- ✅ **Sound Utility Functions**: Eliminated repetitive sound management with `playSound()` and `stopSound()`
- ✅ **Coordinate Transformation Logic**: Sophisticated `transformTouchCoordinates()` utility implemented
- ✅ **Button Bounds Checking**: `isPointInBounds()` utility for consistent button interactions
- ✅ **Paddle Constraint Logic**: `constrainPaddle()` utility for boundary checking
- ✅ **Text Rendering Patterns**: `drawText()` utility for consistent text rendering
- ✅ **Critical Bug Fixes**: Exit button navigation and canvas initialization errors resolved

**Impact**: Eliminated 100+ lines of duplicate code, improved maintainability, and resolved runtime errors.

## 🚧 Current Priority: Function Decomposition (IN PROGRESS)

### HIGH PRIORITY - Break Down Large Functions

**Status**: Planning and analysis phase completed, ready for implementation

#### Target Functions for Decomposition:

##### 1. **Main useEffect Hook** (Lines 216-1037) - 822 lines
**Current Issues**:
- Monolithic structure handling multiple responsibilities
- Difficult to test individual components
- Hard to maintain and debug

**Breakdown Strategy**:
```javascript
// Proposed structure:
const PongV2 = () => {
  // Custom hooks for separation of concerns
  const gameState = useGameState();
  const audioManager = useAudioManager();
  const keyboardInput = useKeyboardInput(gameState);
  const touchInput = useTouchInput(gameState);
  const gamepadInput = useGamepadInput(gameState);
  const fullscreenManager = useFullscreenManager();
  const gameRenderer = useGameRenderer();
  
  // Simplified main component logic
  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
};
```

##### 2. **pollGamepad Function** (Lines 620-720) - 101 lines
**Decomposition Plan**:
- Extract `handleGamepadButtons()` - button state management
- Extract `handleGamepadMovement()` - analog stick processing
- Extract `updateGamepadState()` - state synchronization
- Create `useGamepadInput()` custom hook

##### 3. **toggleFullscreenMode Function** (Lines 720-790) - 71 lines
**Decomposition Plan**:
- Extract `enterFullscreenMode()` - fullscreen entry logic
- Extract `exitFullscreenMode()` - fullscreen exit logic
- Extract `applyFullscreenStyles()` - DOM manipulation
- Create `useFullscreenManager()` custom hook

##### 4. **touchStartHandler Function** (Lines 342-395) - 54 lines
**Decomposition Plan**:
- Extract `handlePauseButtonTouch()` - pause button interaction
- Extract `handleExitButtonTouch()` - exit button interaction
- Extract `handleGameAreaTouch()` - game area touch processing
- Integrate with `useTouchInput()` hook

##### 5. **Draw Functions** (Multiple locations)
**Decomposition Plan**:
- Extract `drawStartScreen()` improvements - modular instruction rendering
- Extract `drawPauseScreen()` improvements - component-based UI
- Create `GameRenderer` utility class for all drawing operations
